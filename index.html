                  Most of our projects are developed in Python. We've created a
                  Flappy Bird game using Pygame and built visual financial tools
                  with Tkinter. Our work often involves data analysis and
                  machine learning, utilizing popular libraries such as
                  Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and others for
                  statistics, machine learning, and neural networks.

                  In our program, collaboration is key. We work closely in teams
                  to explore various concepts together. For our first project,
                  we proposed an idea for the company: Netflix acquiring
                  Flusports. In each class, we analyze and discuss real-world
                  cases, diving deep into the challenges and strategies
                  involved.

                  I'm originally from Yakutia, the coldest inhabited region in
                  the world, where studying became my primary pastime. This love
                  for learning ignited my passion for math and its related
                  fields, such as IT and geometry. I spent countless hours
                  solving Olympiad problems, tackling math exams, and exploring
                  algorithms for fun.

                  When I moved to Moscow for my bachelor's degree, I discovered
                  a vibrant environment that expanded my interests to marketing,
                  finance, business, and sports. Initially, I struggled with
                  shifting from being an A-class specialist to a generalist, but
                  I've come to embrace this transformation. I believe it aligns
                  perfectly with my genuine desire to become a Product
                  Manager—and eventually, a business owner.

                  Currently, I'm working on a project called Share Positive
                  Energy. Drawing from my own experiences, I love receiving
                  feedback and hearing people appreciate my outfits or the help
                  I've given them. These moments truly brighten my day. I keep a
                  personal diary to jot down positive reviews, which serves as a
                  reminder of how others view me during tough times.

                  This project allowed me to practice my Figma skills while
                  honing my abilities as a Product Manager and Designer. I
                  wanted to gain insight into the work of full-stack developers
                  and learn coding with React and Django. Along the way, I even
                  dabbled in manual QA testing!
